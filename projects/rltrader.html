      Surf on Chart: Training RL model for coin trading

        Agents were trained to perform coin trading using reinforcement learning
        algorithms such as DQN, DDQN, A2C, PPO.
        <a href="https://github.com/tensorforce/tensorforce">Tensorforce</a>
        library was used to implement the agents, and multiple tests were
        conducted to find optimal tuning parameters. In our experiments, the PPO
        agent was revealed to generate the highest profit. However, due to the
        high frequency of learning results falling into local optima, they
        cannot be fully trusted.
