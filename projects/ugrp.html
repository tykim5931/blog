      Indoor-Localization of AGV: network packets and trajectory

      <h2>1. Introduction for indoor-localization</h2>
      <p>
        Localization for AGV in indoor environment might be tricky. Because GPS
        does not work indoors, various solutions using networks - such as
        bluetooth, zigbee, wifi - has been researched. Utilizing networks for
        indoor localization can be composed in various ways. One commonly used
        indoor positioning system is a method of determining location through
        the RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) values transmitted from
        sensors in a wireless sensor network.

      <h2>2. KNN + fingerprinting</h2>
      <p>
        RSSI decreases as the distance between the transmitter and receiver
        increases, and this decrease can be used to estimate the distance. This
        can be estimated based on the Path Loss Model, which takes into account
        environmental factors. One of the commonly used indoor positioning
        systems that uses RSSI is based on fingerprinting. In this approach,
        real-time RSSI vectors are matched with pre-built offline RSSI vector
        maps. We tested various comparison methods and constructed a positioning
        system using KNN. We also evaluated the performance of the RSSI
        reconstruction algorithm and the KNN positioning system based on packet
        loss rate and various noise characteristics of RSSI. Additionally, we
        analyzed the difference between the actual and predicted positions of
        AGVs using the loss RSSI reconstruction algorithm.

      <h2>3. Using LSTM network for localizing with lossy RSSI</h2>
      <p>
        In our basic research, we developed an algorithm to complement the RSSI
        vector in a traditional way, and used this method to estimate the
        position of the AGV using KNN by recovering the RSSI vector with loss.
        To create a more robust system, we complemented the AGV's sensor data,
        namely speed, acceleration, and steering angle, by fusion. However, this
        approach has the disadvantage of an unstable initial value problem and
        the inability to effectively utilize the RSSI values obtained from the
        previous point. Since packet loss is estimated only with the RSSI of the
        current point and errors are corrected, we predicted that performance
        could be further improved if the RSSI of the previous point were also
        considered.

        Based on this idea, I used Pytorch to build a 3-layer LSTM network model
        and conducted a study to train the sequential pattern of RSSI data. I
        recorded RSSI values for each situation when the packet loss rate was
        0.0, assuming the sensor nodes (AP) were in fixed positions. The AGV's
        location was labeled, and the RSSI tuple was used as X to change the
        data shape into a supervised learning format. The X data became a
        two-dimensional data (time axis, RSSI intensity). I sliced the data
        along the time axis and trained the model by changing the parameters.

        To be honest, the performance of this experiment was not outstanding,
        mainly due to two reasons: 1) the amount of data was too small, and 2)
        the model we built was not robust enough to handle lossy RSSI vectors.
        Although our goal was to predict the next position, we realized that it
        might be more effective to develop a neural network that can estimate
        which elements in the RSSI vector are lossy and how much packet loss has
        occurred, a network that can recover the RSSI vector based on this
        information, and a network that can estimate the position based on the
        recovered RSSI vector. If we had divided the problem into these three
        sub-tasks and ensemble the results, we might have obtained better
        results.
