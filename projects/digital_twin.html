        The use of 3D data has endless applications, but it would be
        particularly useful in fields such as digital twin systems, where it can
        accurately replicate real-world environments. By utilizing Unity, I
        studied algorithms such as Neural A* and simple waypoint to enable a
        drone object to navigate a 3D city model with rigid body properties and
        reach its destination.
