1. How can I talk to my car?
    The first objective of implementing an autonomous car is: "How can I tell the car to move according to my intentions?".
    Because we can tell that a car is also a robot, we can utilize <b>ROS</b> framework to make connection between the car and the computer.

    For getting used to ROS, visit ros wiki: http://wiki.ros.org/

    <br>
    The link is directed to ROS classic wiki page. I used ROS classic, but actually ROS2 is improved version.
    Also, in case of you are using python3 for development, you surely need to use ROS2 for compatiblity.
    <br>
    We installed an industrial-grade Linux PC in the trunk of the car, connected the vehicle and the computer through CAN communication, and exchanged signals between the car and user application as ROS topics.
    Using ROS, we gained a route to communicate with car. So here, we were able to subscribe information of car ... such as steer, velocity, etc ... and send command to the car ... such as break=10, steer=-10 ...
    Run roscore, run your programs which subscribes & publishes, check if your rosnodes are set properly by your design, and jump into coding the car's brain!
    
2. Making my car drive at 100kph.
    I was in charge of developing smart cruise control(SCC). SCC is all about "moving" the car "back and forth".
    The user application gets the user input such as "100kph".
    Here we have the desired velocity, but driving the car would not work by simply telling the car "run at 100kph!".
    Instead, we need to calcuate break and accel pressure to match the desired velocity.
    <b>PID control</b> is simple but powerful way to staisfy requirements. Yes, finding kp, kd, ki for pid control might go through heuristic methodology,
    yet it is the most efficient way to get desired system outputs by controlling unlinearly related inputs, such as motor power, break pressure, etc.

3. Object detection: Point cloud or Vision?
    I also developed autonomous emergency braking(AEB) system. In AEB system, there's more than just controlling velocity of the car: 
    <b>The car needs to "see" and "understand" the objects.</b>
    <br>
    The reason why car needs to see a object is obvious. Without object perception, the car won't stop because it doesn't know any object is existing!
    What I meant by "understanding" is that
