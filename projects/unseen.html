        The link is directed to ROS classic wiki page. I used ROS classic, but
        actually ROS2 is improved version. Also, in case of you are using
        python3 for development, you surely need to use ROS2 for compatiblity.

        We installed an industrial-grade Linux PC in the trunk of the car,
        connected the vehicle and the computer through CAN communication, and
        exchanged signals between the car and user application as ROS topics.
        Using ROS, we gained a route to communicate with car. So here, we were
        able to subscribe information of car ... such as steer, velocity, etc
        ... and send command to the car ... such as break=10, steer=-10 ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Run roscore, run your programs which subscribes & publishes, check if
        your rosnodes are set properly by your design, and jump into coding the
        car's brain!
